Video Part:

"p" shows mpeg decode output frames, but vsc do not accept the frames in time. There are three causes: 
1. The display is disabled by users. 
2. The rvo is disabled. The rvo is disabled has two causes: 
	a. rvo is disabled by users; 
	b. The decode output an invalid frame(for example, the frames size or the scale is not correct). 
3. The frame rate input to vsc is higher than vout frame rate.

"P" shows no new frame is sent to RVO. There are two causes: 
1. No new frame is sent to the decode.
2. The frame rate sent to the decode is lower than the display framerate.

"D" shows the Linux-To-Ucos buffer(the buffer saves the address & length information) is full(it can contain information of just 8 frames) or not initialized. There are two causes: 
1. The display task is not created. 
2. Linux sends frames too soon. For example, linux sends over 8 frames to ucos once. 

"$" shows the Ucos-To-Linux video buffer is full. For example, for QVGA, the buffer can contain maxium 13 frames. The cause is that Linux does not accept the frame by some reason.

"+" shows that the mpeg encode does not finish when new Vin frame arrives. There are two causes.
1. The Vin frame rate is too high, for example, 60 frames per second.
2. The mpeg encode dies for some reason.

Audio Part:

  MC Error:
    "^" shows MC audio in overflow.
    "&" shows MC audio out underflow

  Jitter Buffer Error: (XX is number)
    "%!XX" showed by FetchPackData function, it means input packet size is not a multiple of size of long.
    "&A!XX" showed by FetchPackData function, it means input packet data address is not begin with 0xA. 

  Audio Task Error: (XX is number) 
    "error! channel[XX] lwTalkerEnableBitFlag 0xXX not match with lwCurrentActiveTalkerCount 0xXX" shows talker count is not match with the talker which has been set codec.
    "AI0" shows read  audio input, but return 0 size of data.

  Two Risc Communication Error:
    "(" shows Linux send tAudioTransferLinuxToUcos packet to uC/os, but channel ID error.
    ")" shows Linux send tAudioTransferLinuxToUcos packet to uC/os, but talker ID error.

For Video & Audio Part:
"~" shows the ucos to linux stream buffer is full. The cause is that Linux does not read the stream in time.
